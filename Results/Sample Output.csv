","Gestational diabetes is a type of diabetes that develops during pregnancy.

If these levels meet the criteria specified in Table 1, then gestational diabetes is diagnosed.","['history of diabetes.1,22\n\nAll women with diabetes diagnosed during pregnancy should including adopting a healthy lifestyle.

","Insulin pump therapy mimics the function of the pancreas by delivering both basal (continuous release over 24 hours) and rapid-acting insulin doses. This helps to regulate blood glucose levels by providing a continuous supply of insulin similar to the pancreas' basal insulin secretion and additional doses to match higher glucose levels during mealtimes, similar to the pancreas' response to food intake. This method aims to improve diabetes control by closely replicating the natural insulin release pattern of a healthy pancreas.","['medication independent of their effect on HbA1c.12,15 For example, recent meta-analyses have shown significant HbA1c reductions and similar hypoglycaemia risk for dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP4 inhibitors) or SGLT2 inhibitors in combination with metformin, compared to metformin alone.37,38\n\na Cost and affordability need to be discussed with the patient as the extended-release formulations are more expensive (compared to immediate-release formulations) and are not currently included in government subsidy lists.\n\nb The evidence in relation to recommended first-line treatment and the role of initial dual therapy in T2DM is expected to continually evolve.

Rotating injection sites is crucial to prevent swelling and ensure proper absorption of insulin because repeatedly injecting insulin into the same spot can lead to lipohypertrophy, which is the thickening and hardening of fatty tissue under the skin.
